# Trakcs, text tracking library

Tracks is not about tracing but tracking. It follows the propagation of texts
and set tracks in it. Tracks do support tracing but its functionality is highly
centered on deciding where the current position is.

Tracks' target usage is when you don't know the exact position but needs to
follow the process to determine where you are.
