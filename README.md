# Trexter, text tracking library

Trexter is a library for tracking text pogression. It aids tracing of text
analysis and set tracks(or milestone) on the way. 

Trexters' target usage is when you don't know the exact position but needs to
follow the process to determine where you are.

Detailed readme will be updated later.

You can refer [R4d](https://github.com/simhyeon/r4d) logger's source code for
detailed usage for now.
